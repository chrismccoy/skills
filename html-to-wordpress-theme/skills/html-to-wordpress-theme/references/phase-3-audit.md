# Phase 3 — Self-Audit & Documentation

Include this in the final chunk alongside documentation.

## Audit Table

For **every** item below:
- **PASS** — cite specific file(s), function(s), and the exact lines checked as evidence. A PASS without evidence is automatically downgraded to FAIL.
- **FAIL** — explain what's wrong, which file(s) are affected, and provide the complete fix (not just a description).
- **N/A** — justify why this check doesn't apply to this specific theme.

In the Evidence column, name the specific files examined for that row. Do not write "all files" — list them.

**Sharing evidence across rows.** When a single file cluster is the evidence for several consecutive checks (e.g. all PHP files for "every file has a docblock", "no stub functions", "tabs not spaces"), you may write the file list once on the first row and use `see #N` on later rows that share the same files. The check description must still be evaluated on the merits — `see #N` only avoids re-typing the file list, not re-doing the check. Do not use `see #N` across distant rows or across categories.

🚫 = blocker. Any blocker FAIL = automatic NO-GO.

| 81 | | Optional | Transient caching (if opted in) — TTL set, cache key namespaced with `{prefix}_`, invalidation hook registered (`save_post`, `customize_save_after`, etc.) | | | |
| 82 | | Optional | Reading time (if opted in) — handles empty content gracefully, formatted via `_n()` with `translators:` comment, cached via transient if caching opted in | | | |
| 83 | | Optional | Related posts (if opted in) — `WP_Query` with `no_found_rows`, excludes current post, cached via transient if caching opted in | | | |
| 84 | | Optional | Schema.org JSON-LD (if opted in) — emitted via `wp_json_encode()` (not string concatenation), conditional per page type, ISO 8601 dates, validated against Google's Rich Results Test (documented in README) | | | |

| 87 | | Optional | Last-updated date (if opted in) — diff threshold respected (default `DAY_IN_SECONDS`) so trivial edits don't trigger the label, marked up with `<time datetime="...">` | | | |
| 88 | | Optional | AJAX handlers (if opted in) — every endpoint calls `check_ajax_referer()` first, nonce localized to JS, non-JS fallback works (standard form / `the_posts_pagination()` still functional with JS disabled) | | | |
| 89 | | Optional | Custom shortcodes (if opted in) — atts parsed via `shortcode_atts()`, output escaped, callbacks return (not echo), each shortcode documented in `README.md` Shortcodes section | | | |
| 90 | | Optional | Plugin integrations (if opted in) — every external API call wrapped in `function_exists()` / `class_exists()` guards, integration scope documented in ⑨ and `README.md` Compatibility section | | | |
